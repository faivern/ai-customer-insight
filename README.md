# üß† AI Customer Insight

**AI Customer Insight** is a command-line tool that turns raw customer feedback into structured business insights using the OpenAI API.

It reads a CSV file with customer reviews or survey feedback, analyzes the data, and generates a **Markdown report** summarizing:
- Overall sentiment and key themes  
- Suggested improvements and quick wins  
- Long-term strategic actions  

This helps businesses quickly understand what customers value and where improvements are needed ‚Äî **without manually reading every comment**.
